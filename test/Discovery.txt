Discovery Session from 2W KLR200 (5cd68f)

It sends 3 different commands 2e, 28, 2a to different broadcast addresses: 00003f, 00003b
Once it receives an answer 2b from devices, directly talks with each one
During discovery process, KLR200 can self register to devices (see self registration to a blind in blindReg.txt)

In this scenario we have 2 Velux windows, 2 Velux blinds, 2 Velux roller shutters
